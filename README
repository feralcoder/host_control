These scripts rely heavily on `getent hosts`.  Some assumptions are made...

- entries include short and long names (IE kgn vs kerrigan) with bare and FQDN versions
- matching ilo entries are structured like 's/<NAME>/<NAME>-ipmi/g'
- the first named entry is the longname FQDN (IE kerrigan.feralcoder.org)
